> MindScribe is a revolutionary web application that combines the power of React, React Router, external APIs, and serverless functions to enhance your learning experience. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, MindScribe empowers users with a unique platform for extracting valuable insights from videos or articles, transforming them into comprehensive summaries, and generating practice questions for further engagement.

### 🚀 [The Story](https://lighthearted-tulumba-ad8574.netlify.app)

In the fast-paced world of finance and investment, keeping up with educational videos can be a challenge. I found myself in this situation, unable to allocate hours to watch these videos due to my increasingly busy schedule. Still, my passion for staying informed persisted.

To address this need for quick and efficient knowledge absorption, I conceptualized MindScribe. This platform was designed to provide concise summaries of investment-related videos and articles. But it didn't stop there. I wanted it to be a place where users could not only read summaries but also practice and ask questions. MindScribe was conceived as a solution to my own problem, and it soon became evident that many others faced a similar dilemma.

The development of MindScribe was driven by my determination to create a tool that could offer more than just condensed content. I envisioned a platform that would empower users with interactive learning and expert guidance.
